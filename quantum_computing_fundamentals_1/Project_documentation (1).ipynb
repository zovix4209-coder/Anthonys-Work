    "## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (medical imaging and or the time frame of when people are diagnosed with damentia vs when their symptoms begin)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe the problem you're addressing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The specific problem is that when your in the radiology/sonography unit its loud, the images arent as clear, it requires alot of radiation, ect and people dont get diagnosed This may be a cause for as to why it takes so long to diagnose others with dementia.]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In drug discovery, pharmaceutical companies need to test millions of potential drug molecules to find one that works. Classical computers must test each molecule one at a time through simulations, which takes 10+ years and costs billions of dollars. Many promising treatments are never discovered because searching through all possibilities is computationally impossible.\n",

    "## 🌀 QUANTUM THINKING SHIFT\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does quantum thinking change your perspective on this problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Learning Quantum Computing:**\n",
    "[What did you think was the only way to solve this problem?]\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Learning Quantum Principles:**\n",
    "[How has your thinking shifted? What new possibilities do you see?]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Before quantum computing, I thought we had to check each drug molecule individually - there was no shortcut. After learning about superposition and interference, I realized quantum computers can test multiple molecules simultaneously and use interference to amplify the best candidates, fundamentally changing what's possible in drug discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**What becomes possible with quantum thinking that wasn't before?**\n",

    "## ⚛️ QUANTUM CONCEPTS I'LL USE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check all quantum concepts that apply to your project and explain HOW each one connects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Superposition\n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how being in multiple states simultaneously helps solve your problem]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Superposition allows testing all possible drug molecules at once instead of one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Entanglement  \n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how qubits that can't be described independently help solve your problem]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In quantum cryptography, entangled qubits ensure that any eavesdropping attempt is immediately detected because measuring one qubit affects the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Interference\n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how amplifying right answers and canceling wrong ones helps solve your problem]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Interference amplifies molecular structures with desired properties while canceling out poor candidates, reducing the search space dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how this algorithm concept connects - even if just as a demonstration of quantum speedup]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** While Deutsch-Jozsa solves a specific academic problem, it demonstrates the core principle my project uses: quantum parallelism with interference to get answers in one query instead of many.\n",
